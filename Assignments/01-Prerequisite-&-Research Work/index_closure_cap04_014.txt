>>> What is Closure ?
    => Closure is bundle of functions.
    => There is one outer function and second inner function.
    => It is a feature that allow inner function to access outer function scope.
    => Lexical Scoping:
       A function scopeâ€™s ability to access variables from the parent scope is known as lexical scope.
       
    => Example : 
                function outer(){
                    let name = "Ravi"; // name is local variable scoped under outer function
    
                    function inner(){  // this is inner function that form closure 
                        return name;   // use name that is declared by outer function
                    }
                }
